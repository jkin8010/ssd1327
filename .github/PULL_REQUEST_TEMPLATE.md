Hi! Thank you for helping out with SSD1306 development! Please:

- [ ] Check that you've added documentation to any new methods
- [ ] Rebase from `master` if you're not already up to date
- [ ] Add or modify an example if there are changes to the public API
- [ ] Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the **Unreleased** section under the appropriate heading (**Added**, **Fixed**, **Changed**, etc)
- [ ] Run `rustfmt` on the project with `cargo fmt --all` - CI will not pass without this step
- [ ] Check that your branch is up to date with master and that CI is passing once the PR is opened

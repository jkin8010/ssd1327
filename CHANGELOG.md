<!-- next-header -->

## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Added

- [#161](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/161) Added a `set_mirror` method to enable or disable display mirroring.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-07-08

### Changed

- **(breaking)** [#158](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/158) Migrate away from `generic-array` to a solution using const generics. This raises the crate MSRV to 1.51.

## [0.6.0] - 2021-06-22

### Changed

- **(breaking)** [#156](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/156) Migrate from `embedded-graphics` to `embedded-graphics-core`.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) `BufferedGraphicsMode::set_pixel` now accepts a `bool` instead of a `u8` for the pixel color value.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) `display_on` is now called `set_display_on`.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) `TerminalMode::get_position` is now called `position` to conform with Rust API guidelines.
- **(breaking)** [#150](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/150) Refactor the crate API to be more versatile and to make code clearer to understand.

  A graphics mode initialisation now looks like this:

  ```rust
  use ssd1306::{prelude::*, I2CDisplayInterface, Ssd1306};

  let interface = I2CDisplayInterface::new(i2c);

  let mut display = Ssd1306::new(interface, DisplaySize128x64, DisplayRotation::Rotate0)
      .into_buffered_graphics_mode();

  display.init().unwrap();
  ```

## [0.5.2] - 2021-04-19

## [0.4.1] - 2020-12-01

### Changed

- [#137](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/137) Replaced `TerminalMode` font with a new, more consistent one. This now uses the `zxpix` font from <https://jared.geek.nz/2014/jan/custom-fonts-for-microcontrollers>.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-08-03

### Added

- [#121](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/121) Added brightness control with the `set_brightness()` method.
- [#118](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/118) `DisplayModeTrait::into_properties()` new method that consumes the driver and returns the `DisplayProperties`

### Changed

- **(breaking)** [#129](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/129) `TerminalMode::set_rotation` now resets the cursor position
- **(breaking)** [#125](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/125) Redesigned display size handling.
- **(breaking)** [#126](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/126) Moved `reset` method to `DisplayModeTrait`. If the prelude is not used, add either `use ssd1306::prelude::*` or `ssd1306::mode::displaymode::DisplayModeTrait` to your imports.
- **(breaking)** [#119](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/119) Remove `DisplayMode` and `RawMode`
- [#120](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/120) Update to v0.4 [`display-interface`](https://crates.io/crates/display-interface)
- **(breaking)** [#118](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/118) Change `release` method to return the display interface instead of the `DisplayProperties`.
- **(breaking)** [#116](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/116) Replace custom I2C and SPI interfaces by generic [`display-interface`](https://crates.io/crates/display-interface)
- **(breaking)** [#113](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/113) Removed public `send_bounded_data` from DisplayInterface and implementations

### Fixed

- [#129](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/129) Fixed `Rotate90` and `Rotate270` rotation modes for `TerminalMode`

## [0.3.1] - 2020-03-21

### Fixed

- Fix docs.rs build config

## [0.3.0] - 2020-03-20

### Fixed

- [#111](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/111) Fix TerminalMode offset for smaller displays.

### Added

- [#111](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/111) Add support for modules with a 64x48px display size.

### Changed

- **(breaking)** [#112](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/112) Upgrade to embedded-graphics 0.6.0
- [#107](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/107) Migrate from Travis to CircleCI
- [#105](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/105) Reduce flash usage by around 400 bytes by replacing some internal `unwrap()`s with `as` coercions.
- [#106](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/106) Optimise internals by using iterators to elide bounds checks. Should also speed up `GraphicsMode` (and `embedded-graphics` operations) with a cleaned-up `set_pixel`.
- [#108](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/108) Add an example using `DisplayProperties.draw()` to send a raw buffer of random bytes to the display over I2C.

### Added

- [#110](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/110) Add an animated image example `rtfm_dvd` using [RTFM](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm)

## [0.3.0-alpha.4] - 2020-02-07

### Added

- [#101](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/101) Add support for modules with a 72x40px display size. These are often advertised as 70x40px displays which are likely the same hardware. An example is also added - `graphics_i2c_72x40`.

### Fixed

- Fix docs.rs build by targeting `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

### Changed

- **(breaking)** Upgrade embedded-graphics from `0.6.0-alpha.2` to version `0.6.0-alpha.3`
- [#106](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/106) Switch out some `for` loops for iterators internally to speed up data transfers and reduce code size in `--release` mode.

## [0.3.0-alpha.3] - 2020-02-03

### Changed

- [#97](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/97) Use the new `Triangle` primitive from Embedded Graphics 0.6.0-alpha.2 in the three SSD1306 `graphics*.rs` examples
- [#103](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/103) Pin embedded-graphics version to 0.6.0-alpha.2

## [0.3.0-alpha.2]

### Fixed

- [#80](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/80) `TerminalMode` now has a cursor. Newlines (`\n`) and carriage returns (`\r`) are now supported.

### Changed

- [#94](https://github.com/jamwaffles/ssd1306/pull/94) Programs that only change some parts of the display should now run much faster. The driver keeps track of changed pixels and only sends a bounding box of updated pixels instead of updating the entire display every time.

## [0.3.0-alpha.1]

### Changed

- **(breaking)** Upgraded to Embedded Graphics 0.6.0-alpha.2

## 0.2.6

### Added

- Added a changelog!
- Display power control (#86) - call `.display_on(true)` or `.display_on(false)` to turn on or off the display respectively.

### Fixed

- Doc examples are now tested in CI (#89)

### Changed

- Builder docs clarify the order of method calls (#89)
